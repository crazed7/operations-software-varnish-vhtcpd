0.0.10 - 2013-09-09
  Bugfix: was not handling connection close during RECVWAIT
    state on purger connections.

0.0.9 - 2013-08-14
  Limit HTTP purge connections to 15 minutes or 10K requests
    per-connection.  Otherwise they seem to live indefinitely,
    which is bound to eventually trigger a bug in vhtcpd or
    varnish somewhere.
  Added queue_size and queue_max_size stats output.  queue_size
    is the current size at the moment of stats snapshot, whereas
    max tracks the peak value since initialization (even a spike
    between snapshots), and is reset on queue wipe due to overflow.

0.0.8 - 2013-07-02
  Fixed HTTP response parsing bug that caused queue backlog
    and constant re-send of a certain queue item.
  Added an "inpkts_dequeued" stat, which advances when
    all purgers have dequeued a given request.

0.0.7 - 2013-07-02
  Handles large HTTP response bodies more gracefully
  Small socket tweak for ephemeral port allocation, maybe

0.0.6 - 2013-05-30
  Now allows text hostnames in cache cmdline args
  Upgraded hostname regex matches from POSIX ERE to PCRE
  Fixed a couple of minor memory management bugs that
    happened to not be causing any real problems, at
    least in the build environment being tested.

0.0.5 - 2013-05-29
  First seemingly production-ready release, will track
   significant changes in this file from here out.
