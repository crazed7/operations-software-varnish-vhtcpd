0.0.8 - 2013-07-02
  Fixed HTTP response parsing bug that caused queue backlog
    and constant re-send of a certain queue item.
  Added an "inpkts_dequeued" stat, which advances when
    all purgers have dequeued a given request.

0.0.7 - 2013-07-02
  Handles large HTTP response bodies more gracefully
  Small socket tweak for ephemeral port allocation, maybe

0.0.6 - 2013-05-30
  Now allows text hostnames in cache cmdline args
  Upgraded hostname regex matches from POSIX ERE to PCRE
  Fixed a couple of minor memory management bugs that
    happened to not be causing any real problems, at
    least in the build environment being tested.

0.0.5 - 2013-05-29
  First seemingly production-ready release, will track
   significant changes in this file from here out.
