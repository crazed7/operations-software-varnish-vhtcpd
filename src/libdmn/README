libdmn is copied from gdnsd.  I get the whole thing about embedding
  library sources.  I'm the author of both projects, and libdmn's API
  and code aren't sufficiently factored out to start making real releases
  of it as a stable library independent of the gdnsd project.  I hope
  to remedy that situation, but part of the process of finding the problems
  is trying to use it in other projects...

Changes from gdnsd's master branch circa gdnsd-1.8.2:
  Support non-pthreads build by wrapping pthreads-specific stuff in:
      #ifdef LIBDMN_THREADED
    and providing alternative unthreaded variant code where applicable.
    (note this change probably never merges elsewhere, since in a shared
     lib we'd probably always link libpthread and support threads, right?)
